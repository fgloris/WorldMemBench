WorldMemBench is an open benchmark for measuring the memory capabilities of learned world models. The benchmark emphasizes both first-person and third-person perspectives, diverse action spaces, and long-term temporal consistency.

This repository contains the website, specification, and pointers to datasets and evaluation code. The dataset itself is hosted separately (see README for details).
